# OsuBackup
### Currently, this project only supports saving all beatmap IDs, and not restoring them automatically.

**OsuBackup is a project developed by [@RegexMC](https://twitter.com/regexmc) to backup and restore your osu beatmaps.**

It is intended to be used when resetting your device or when switching devices _permanently_. It is not intended to maintain beatmaps between devices and be used frequently.

I am currently waiting for a response from osu support to see whether I can continue with this project or not, and if so, what delay I should put in place when downloading beatmaps, if any.

## Usage
Download the latest release from the [releases page](https://github.com/RegexMC/OsuBackup/releases)

Ensure [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) is installed. However, if using the portable executable you can skip this step.

Open the program _(main.py, main.exe)_.

Follow the steps the program walks you through. The output file name must be valid, and the osu folder must exist and be valid. If you encounter any issues with this please [create an issue](https://github.com/RegexMC/OsuBackup/issues).
